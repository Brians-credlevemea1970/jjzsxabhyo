OMG, just got done with iHostage and wow, what a rollercoaster, you know what I mean? Like, I thought itâ€™d be just another hostage flick, but then it hits you outta nowhere with that crazy plot twist. Mind blown. It's like, I didn't even know how to process it at first, haha.

Anyway, the main character, right? Loved how they made him all flawed and human. Not like those invincible heroes we usually see. Seriously, the bit where he loses his cool and starts yelling at everyoneâ€”kinda me when I'm hangry, LOL. 

> So there I was, thinking itâ€™s gonna be a decent watch, and suddenly I'm on the edge of my seat. And don't even get me started on the villainâ€™s monologue. Like, dude, just get to the point. We've got things to do, places to be! But I guess it worked? IDK, maybe it did.

Oh, and speaking of, I was just about to download the movie, hoping for a chill night. Surprise, surprise... ended up pacing my living room, haha. I mean, you watch a movie expecting to relax, and then BAM, your whole evening's an adrenaline surge.

Wait, did you notice how they kept building tension with the music too? My heart couldn't take it, I swear. And the ending, tho! Such a cliffhangerâ€”I can't believe they did us like that. There better be a sequel, or I'm writing a strongly worded tweet ðŸ˜œ.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { / Why did I write this? / }

Anyway, at least it kept me awake tonight. Now, I might need a strong coffee in the morning. ðŸ˜… So, lesson learned: next time someone suggests iHostage, maybe plan for a night when Iâ€™m not so close to passing out, haha. What did you think of it?
